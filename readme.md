## Version

Using the nightly toolchain

```bash
rustup default nightly
```

Latest version I updated to. 1.40.0-nightly.

```bash
# rustc --version
# rustc 1.40.0-nightly (1423bec54 2019-11-05)
rustup update nightly-2019-11-05
```

You don't always want the latest nightly even if you want the latest features as it's might missing certain tools.

This [rustup component history page](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/index.html) will tell you which version fits your needs.
